Online Ventures Code Style Guide
================================

After some time of not regulating code style, our codebases have become a bit sloppy.

To help regulate this disaster, here is an official manual of our internal code style, along with some examples.

## Table of Contents

1. [Ruby](#ruby)
2. [Coffeescript](#coffeescript)
3. [Sass](#sass)
4. [HTML/ERb](#html)
5. [Git](#git)

## Examples

1. [Ruby]()
2. [Coffeescript]()
3. [Sass]()
4. [HTML/ERb]()

## Ruby


## Coffeescript


## Sass


## HTML / ERb

* Prefer double quotes for element attributes
* Use partials in a way that allows `<%= render @objects %>`

## Git

* Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
    * The first line is a summary in ~50 characters or less.
    * A blank line is included after the first line, and in between paragraphs.
    * Messages are written in the imperative: `Fix bug`, as opposed to `Fixed bug` or `Fixes bug`.
